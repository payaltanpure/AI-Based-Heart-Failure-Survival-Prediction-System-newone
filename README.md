#  Heart Failure Prediction System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an AI-based web application that predicts the survival outcome of heart failure patients using clinical health parameters. It helps in early risk assessment and supports medical decision-making.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Predict whether a heart failure patient is likely to survive or not  
- Use machine learning for accurate outcome prediction  
- Provide a simple and user-friendly web interface  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS  
- **Backend:** Python, Flask  
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn  
- **Data Handling:** NumPy, Pickle  
- **Deployment:** Localhost / GitHub

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model
- Trained on clinical heart failure dataset  
- Features include age, anaemia, diabetes, ejection fraction, blood pressure, etc.  
- StandardScaler used for feature scaling

## ⚙️ System Workflow
1. User enters patient health details  
2. Input data is scaled using trained scaler  
3. ML model predicts survival outcome  
4. Result is displayed on the web interface
